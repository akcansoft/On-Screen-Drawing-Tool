Lightweight on-screen annotation tool for Windows, built with AutoHotkey v2 and GDI+.

Draw directly on top of any screen with multiple tools (freehand, line, rectangle, ellipse, circle, arrow), configurable hotkeys, and an INI-based settings system. Run it as source (`.ahk`) or as a compiled standalone `.exe`.

## Highlights

- Fast overlay drawing with GDI+ anti-aliased rendering
- Drawing tools: freehand, straight line, rectangle, ellipse, circle, arrow
- **Ortho mode** (F8 by default) — locks line and arrow drawing to horizontal or vertical axis
- Dynamic line width and opacity controls
- Color palette with single-key shortcuts (fully configurable via Settings)
- Built-in hotkeys help dialog (<kbd>F1</kbd> by default, configurable)
- **Undo / Redo** support for all drawing actions including clear — full linear history, no steps lost
- Clear all drawings with a single key; clear is itself undoable/redoable
- Right-click in-place settings panel: color picker, line width, opacity, quick actions
- Pen cursor while drawing mode is active
- **Always-on-top** help and settings windows that don't get lost behind the overlay
- Multi-monitor support — starts on the monitor the mouse cursor is on
- Per-monitor DPI awareness with multiple fallbacks for mixed-scaling setups
- Shapes are preserved across drawing sessions (within the same monitor)
- Remembers last used drawing settings (color, line width, opacity) across restarts

## Requirements

- Windows
- [AutoHotkey v2.x](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (for source usage only)
- `Gdip.ahk` in the same folder as the main script

If you use the compiled `.exe`, **AutoHotkey installation** is not required.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run from source

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Keep these files in the same directory:
   - `On Screen Drawing.ahk`
   - `Gdip.ahk`
   - `AppLib.ahk`
   - `Settings.ahk`
   - `Help.ahk`
   - `settings.ini` (optional — defaults are applied automatically)
   - `app_icon.ico` (optional — used for the tray icon)
3. Run `On Screen Drawing.ahk`.
4. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd> (default) to start drawing mode.

### Option 2: Run compiled EXE

1. Download the latest release `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/akcansoft/On-Screen-Drawing-Tool/releases) page.
2. Optionally place `settings.ini` next to the `.exe` for custom settings.
3. Run the executable.

## Default Controls

### Global hotkeys (always active)

| Hotkey | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd> | Toggle drawing mode on/off |
| <kbd>F1</kbd> | Show hotkeys help |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> | Exit the application |

### While in drawing mode

| Hotkey / Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Clear all drawings (undoable) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> | Undo last action (shape or clear) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> | Redo last undone action |
| <kbd>XButton1</kbd> (Mouse Back) | Undo last action |
| <kbd>XButton2</kbd> (Mouse Forward) | Redo last undone action |
| <kbd>F8</kbd> | Toggle Ortho mode (line/arrow only) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>NumpadAdd</kbd> | Increase line width |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>NumpadSub</kbd> | Decrease line width |
| <kbd>WheelUp</kbd> / <kbd>WheelDown</kbd> | Increase / decrease line width |
| Right-click on overlay | Open in-place settings panel |

### Tool selection (hold modifier while clicking to draw)

| Modifier | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| *(none)* | Freehand |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> | Straight line |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> | Rectangle |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> | Ellipse |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd> | Circle (radius = max of X/Y drag distance) |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> | Arrow (with auto-sized filled arrowhead) |

### Color hotkeys (default, configurable in Settings)

| Key | Color | Key | Color | Key | Color |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Red | <kbd>m</kbd> | Magenta | <kbd>s</kbd> | Brown |
| <kbd>g</kbd> | Green | <kbd>c</kbd> | Cyan | <kbd>w</kbd> | White |
| <kbd>b</kbd> | Blue | <kbd>o</kbd> | Orange | <kbd>n</kbd> | Gray |
| <kbd>y</kbd> | Yellow | <kbd>v</kbd> | Violet | <kbd>k</kbd> | Black |

> Color hotkeys are only active while drawing mode is on and the mouse cursor is on the active monitor.

## Ortho Mode

Press <kbd>F8</kbd> (configurable) while in drawing mode to toggle Ortho mode on/off. A tooltip confirms the current state.

When Ortho mode is active, **line** and **arrow** tools are constrained to the dominant axis — horizontal if the horizontal drag distance is greater, vertical otherwise. All other tools (freehand, rect, ellipse, circle) are unaffected.

## Undo / Redo

The undo/redo system treats every action — including **Clear** — as a step in a single linear history. You can freely undo and redo across clear operations without losing any shapes.

The history size limit (`MaxHistorySize`, default 200) applies to the total number of entries including clear markers.

## Right-Click Settings Panel

Right-clicking anywhere on the overlay opens a compact floating panel:

![](docs/screen-shot-2.png) ![](docs/screen-shot-3.png)

- **Color grid** — configured colors in a 3-column grid. Active color marked with ✓; hotkey hints shown on each swatch (configurable).
- **Line width** — numeric edit field with up/down spinner.
- **Opacity** — numeric edit field with up/down spinner (0–255).
- **Quick action buttons:** Undo, Redo, Clear, Help, Stop Drawing, Exit App

The panel snaps within the active monitor's bounds. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or click away to close it.

## Tray Menu

Right-clicking the tray icon shows:

- **Help** — displays the help window (app info, hotkeys, author links)
- **Settings** — opens the application settings window
- **Restart Application** — reloads the script
- **Start / Stop Drawing** — toggles drawing mode
- **Exit** — closes the app

## Settings Window

Open via tray menu or the Settings button in the Help window. Changes to hotkeys or colors require a restart to take effect (the app will prompt you).

Tabs:
- **General** — numeric settings and behavior toggles
- **Hotkeys** — all configurable hotkeys
- **Colors** — color palette management (add, edit, delete entries)

## settings.ini Reference

The app reads `settings.ini` from the script/exe directory on startup. Missing keys fall back to defaults.

> All settings can also be edited through the built-in **Settings window** (tray menu → Settings). Changes are saved back to `settings.ini` automatically.

### [Settings] keys

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MinLineWidth` | Minimum allowed stroke width | `1` |
| `MaxLineWidth` | Maximum allowed stroke width | `10` |
| `DrawAlpha` | Drawing opacity (0–255) | `200` |
| `FrameIntervalMs` | Overlay redraw interval (ms) | `16` |
| `MinPointStep` | Min pixel distance between freehand points | `3` |
| `MaxHistorySize` | Maximum undo/redo steps | `200` |
| `ClearOnExitDraw` | Discard shapes when exiting drawing mode | `false` |
| `ShowColorHints` | Show hotkey hints on color swatches | `true` |
| `SaveLastUsedOnExit` | Remember color, width, opacity on exit | `true` |
| `showHelpOnStartup` | Show help window on application start | `true` |

### [Hotkeys] keys

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ToggleDrawingMode` | Start/Stop drawing | `^F9` |
| `ExitApp` | Close application | `^+F12` |
| `ClearDrawing` | Clear all shapes | `Esc` |

### v1.5 19/03/2026

- **Settings Window**: All application settings (general options, hotkeys, color palette) can now be edited through a built-in GUI. Changes are saved to `settings.ini` automatically; hotkey and color changes take effect after restart.
- **Help Window**: The separate About dialog and hotkeys help message box have been merged into a single always-on-top Help window. Includes app info, author links, full hotkey list, and a startup visibility toggle.
- **Ortho Mode**: New F8 toggle (configurable) constrains line and arrow drawing to horizontal or vertical axis, similar to CAD ortho mode.
- **Undo/Redo overhaul**: Clear is now a fully undoable/redoable step in the linear history. No shapes are lost when undoing or redoing across clear operations.
- **Standard undo/redo hotkeys**: Changed from Backspace/Shift+Backspace to Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y.

### v1.4 12/03/2026

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens when pressing the toggle hotkey**
- Check `ToggleDrawingMode` in `settings.ini`.
- Ensure no other application is capturing the same hotkey.

**Error about GDI+ on startup**
- Verify that `Gdip.ahk` exists in the same folder as the script and is compatible with AHK v2.

**Wrong position or scale on multi-monitor / mixed-DPI setups**
- The script applies per-monitor DPI awareness with multiple fallbacks. Restart after changing monitor layout or DPI settings.

**Color hotkeys do not work while drawing**
- Confirm all `[Colors]` entries use the `0xRRGGBB` format.
- Make sure the mouse cursor is on the active drawing monitor.

**Shapes disappear when re-entering drawing mode**
- Check that `ClearOnExitDraw` is set to `false` in `settings.ini`.
- Note: switching to a different monitor always resets the shape history.
